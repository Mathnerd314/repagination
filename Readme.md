Re-Pagination
===

This add-on is mostly a rewrite of the old re-pagination/antipagination extension for Firefox.
However some code remains unchanged.
Lev assigned ownership over to this project, so that this incarnation is now the official one.

Features
===

* Restartless under Firefox 4
* All, limited and slideshow

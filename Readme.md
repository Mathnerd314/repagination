Re-Pagination
===

This add-on is mostly a rewrite of the old re-pagination/antipagination extension for Firefox.
Lev assigned ownership over to this project, so that this incarnation is now the official one.

Features
===

* Fully restartless
* Should prevent some |jank|ing compared to the original extension
* All, limited and slideshow
